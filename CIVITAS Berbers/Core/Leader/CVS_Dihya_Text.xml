Go now and guard against your enemies: deny them any quarter and let the perseverance of the Berbers be known far and wide.</Text>

				Dihya was a Berber warrior-queen known for resisting the Arab invasions of the 7th century. She was a member of the Jarawa tribe, which was part of the Zenata confederacy, located in eastern Algeria. Her Arab opponents knew her as al-Kahina, the soothsayer. They thought she had the power of prophecy and believed her to be a powerful sorceress. According to some historians, Dihya may have had partly Byzantine heritage as well. Little is known of Dihya’s personal life, however. Her faith is a particularly complicated sticking point. The Arabs wrote in their histories that she was Jewish, and indeed the Jarawa tribe is believed to have converted to Judaism at some point, although it is unknown if they later adopted Christianity. Additionally, one historian, al-Maliki, notes that she was accompanied in her travels by an idol, perhaps referring to an icon of the Virgin Mary or a Christian saint. It could also have been an idol of an indigenous Berber deity. Unrelatedly, Dihya may also have had an interest in studying desert birds.

				Dihya ruled over her kingdom, which stretched from the Aures mountains in the north to the oasis of Ghadames in the south, for 13 years. She came to power in the aftermath of the defeat of another great Berber resistance figure named Kusaila, who had died in 688, and quickly took up the mantle of the fight against the Umayyad invaders. After Hassan ibn Numan conquered the Byzantine Exarchate of Africa, and its capital of Carthage, he moved onto Numidia, where was told that the most powerful monarch in Ifriqiya was the Dihya, the Queen of the Berbers.

				The Berber and Arab armies met near a river in the northern Aures mountains near modern-day Meskiana, Algeria. Diya concealed her armies in the mountains and, at night, moved her army to surround ibn Numan’s troops. She also dispersed her archers among her camel cavalry to hide their true numbers. When the Arabs attacked, they were surprised by showers of arrows that arose from among the Dihya’s camelry. The Berber cavalry then entered the fray, decimating the Arab army. Thus concluded the Battle of Wadi Nini, also known as the Battle of the Camels in memory of Dihya’s successful tactics. The Berbers chased the retreating Arab army all the way to Gabes, expelling them from Ifriqiya. The Berbers took many prisoners, but Dihya freed all of them save a nephew of Hassan ibn Numan, named Khalid ibn Yazid. The battle was so devastating to the Arabs that they named the wadi where the battle took place Nahr al-Bala, or River of Hardship.

			<Text>For the next 4 to 5 years, the Arabs were unable to launch another attack on Ifriqiya and were forced to retreat to Cyrenaica to recover their forces. When they did return, however, their forces were overwhelming. Dihya recognized this and resorted to scorched earth tactics in an attempt to deny the invaders the benefit of their captured lands. This alienated some of her people, however, particularly those who lived amongst the oases. Nevertheless, the invasion continued, and the Arabs captured many cities in modern-day Tunisia, including Gafsa and Gabes. Dihya attempted to block the Arab advance at Tabarka, on the northern Tunisian coast, but after a bitter fight was repulsed. So, Dihya’s forces were pushed back into the Aures mountains.</Text>

			<Text>Dihya died not too long after; the exact circumstances surrounding her death are unknown, however. She may have died fighting the Arabs, sword in hand, or may have swallowed poison to avoid capture by the enemy. Ibn Khaldun states that she was captured and decapitated, with her head sent to the Caliph in Damascus, but this is most likely an Arab invention. Whatever her fate, it is believed that Dihya’s sons died alongside her. She was buried in the city of Khenchela and the site of her final defeat was immortalized with the name Bir el Kahina, the Well of Kahina.</Text>

				Dihya remains a prominent figure in Berber cultural consciousness, representing the fighting spirit of the Berber people and their fierce independence. The memory of this great queen, perhaps the only woman to lead the resistance against growing power of the Arab Muslim caliphates, endures even to this very day as a powerful symbol of hope and strength over a millennium after her death.

				Dihya is all about maximizing defensive capabilities. Scorched earth tactics mean that pillagers in her lands will find no quarter, and her units receive a considerable boost to their strength when fightin in Berber lands. The Berber Arer Warriors complement this playstyle as well, but can also go on the offensive. If Dihya settles in a heavily mountainous area, she will be able to leverage her production bonus both for infrastructural and military purposes. Get on her good side by maintaining a healthy economy and a happy populace.
